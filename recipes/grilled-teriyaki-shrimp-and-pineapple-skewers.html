    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        These savory-sweet shrimp skewers are easy to make and cook in just a few
        minutes. They are perfect for summer weeknights or weekend dinner parties.
        Prep the sauce ahead of time for an even faster dinner. I prefer to use
        jumbo shrimp (21 to 25 per pound), however use what you have on hand.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <h4>Sauce:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>⅓ cup water</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon honey</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon grated fresh garlic</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger</li>
        <li>1 pound jumbo shrimp</li>
        <li>½ fresh pineapple, cored and cut into 1 1/2-inch pieces</li>
        <li>skewers</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons minced fresh cilantro (Optional)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon toasted sesame seeds (Optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Steps</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Combine water, soy sauce, brown sugar, honey, garlic, and ginger in a
            small saucepan and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to
            medium-low and simmer until sauce has reduced and thickened slightly, 8
            to 10 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil grate.
            Thread shrimp and pineapple alternately onto skewers and place on a
            platter.
        </li>
        <li>
            Arrange skewers on the hot grate. Grill 2 to 3 minutes per side, or
            until shrimp is opaque and cooked through. Turn grill to low heat and
            brush sauce on both sides of skewers. Transfer to a serving platter and
            sprinkle with cilantro and sesame seeds.
        </li>
    </ol>
